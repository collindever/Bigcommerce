Attempts at Automating tasks based on the specific Retail Setup I work with

I am working with an older site that runs on a basic auth API and produces XML data.  Most of the Bigcommerce documentation I think is focused on newer versions, there for i have not had any luck with the Python Bigcommerce 0.11.0 library, instead most of this I think will end up relying on the requests library as well as the ElementTree library for working with XML data.

The ulitimate goal will be to create scripts that can be implemented on the server for automation of tasks currently being done by hand.

First goal will be batch inventory update once a day
Second will be real time order updating

The challenge is interlinking the ecommerce software we are using, Bigcommerce, and our POS software RetailPro8

Any and all help is more than appreciated.
